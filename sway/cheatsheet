Garuda  Sway-WM CheatSheet :

- Sway is documentated through man pages unlike i3.To get a overview of what to expect you can read 'man 5 sway'. The pages are then spilt into topics - some the
important ones are listed at the bottom of the document. Waybar is also documented through man pages - 'man 5 waybar'.
